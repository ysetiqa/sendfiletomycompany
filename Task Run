Yes, you are absolutely correct! Here's a breakdown of your statement with explanations:

---

### **1. `Task.Run(() => { })` (No Variable Assignment)**
- **Scenario**: You start a task but don't assign it to a variable or wait for it.
- **Action Needed**: 
  - **No need to dispose** because you aren't interacting with the task or accessing unmanaged resources.
  - The garbage collector will clean it up when it's no longer needed.

---

### **2. `var task = Task.Run(() => { });` (Assigned to a Variable, No `Wait()` or `Result`)**
- **Scenario**: You assign the task to a variable but don't call `Wait()`, access `Result`, or otherwise block on it.
- **Action Needed**: 
  - **No need to dispose** because unmanaged resources (like `WaitHandle`) are not allocated unless explicitly accessed.
  - You can let the task complete and rely on garbage collection.

---

### **3. `var task = Task.Run(() => { });` with `task.Wait()`**
- **Scenario**: You start a task, assign it to a variable, and use `Wait()` to block until it completes.
- **Action Needed**:
  - **Dispose the task manually** after it completes because `Wait()` indirectly accesses the `Task.WaitHandle`, which allocates unmanaged resources.
  - Alternatively, switch to `await` for a non-blocking approach and eliminate the need to dispose.

---

### **4. Use `await task`**
- **Scenario**: Instead of using `Wait()`, you use `await` to asynchronously wait for the task to complete.
- **Action Needed**:
  - **No need to dispose** because `await` does not allocate unmanaged resources (like `WaitHandle`), and the runtime handles cleanup.

### **Summary**
| Scenario                                      | Need to Dispose? |
|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| `Task.Run(() => { })` (no variable assigned)  | No                |
| `var task = Task.Run(() => { });`             | No                |
| `var task = Task.Run(() => { }); task.Wait();`| Yes               |
| `var task = Task.Run(() => { }); await task;` | No                |

---

### **Best Practice**
- Prefer **`await`** over `Wait()` whenever possible for cleaner, non-blocking code.
- Only use `Dispose()` when you're interacting with unmanaged resources (e.g., `Wait()` or `WaitHandle`) or managing a large number of tasks in performance-critical scenarios.
